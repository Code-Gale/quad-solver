Quadratic Equation Solver
Project Overview

This Python script, quadratic_solver.py, is designed to solve quadratic equations of the form Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0. It provides a quick and easy way to find the solutions (roots) of quadratic equations using the quadratic formula.
Features

    Quadratic Equation Solver: The script takes the coefficients A, B, and C as input and calculates the roots of the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula.

    Real and Complex Roots: The solver handles equations with real and complex roots, providing accurate solutions in both cases.

    User-Friendly: It offers a simple and user-friendly interface for users to input the coefficients and obtain the solutions.

Getting Started
Prerequisites

    Python 3.x

Usage

    Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash

git clone https://github.com/Code-Gale/quad-solver.git

    Navigate to the project directory:

bash

cd quad-solver

    Run the script, quadratic_solver.py, and provide the coefficients A, B, and C as command-line arguments. For example:

bash

python quadratic_solver.py

Replace A, B, and C with the coefficients of your quadratic equation. The script will calculate and display the solutions for the equation Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0.
